# Image Classifier: Plant Health

## Summary

Due to climate change, there is an increased need to address resource scarcity. It is desirable to have an automated plant health monitoring system that can detect when a plant is experiencing stress such as wilting (underwatering). The user can experiment with the growing environment (i.e. the watering frequency) and use the monitoring system to track the plant's health. 

This project is a prototype of such a monitoring system.  We use TensorFlow and Keras to create an image classifier which detects if a house plant is healthy or wilted. We make adjustments to fix the overfitting and pursue hyperparameter tuning. 

## Description

We construct a database of images of common house plants from Google Images using the batch downloader [Fatkun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/efcapamiilmdfbbilogcddbdckjhpajj). The two categories are "healthy" and "wilted". We will train a neural net to predict which category a given image belongs to.

*** This project is in progress. Stay tuned for recent updates. ***
